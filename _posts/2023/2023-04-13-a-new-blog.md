Welcome to the new `json-everything` blog!

This will be a place where I can write about all things JSON.  Most of the time, it'll be a place where I can answer common questions so I have somewhere to point people when they ask.

I'll also highlight anything that looks interesting to me.  This could be use cases from StackOverflow, other JSON-related projects, or even explanations of decisions that I'm making for one of the `json-everything` libraries.

> But don't you already write posts for the [JSON Schema blog](https://json-schema.org/blog)?

I do!  Thanks for noticing!

I may copy/re-blog those posts over here, but for the most part, JSON Schema stuff has a primary home there.

I mainly wanted this site for non-JSON-Schema JSON-related content.  For example, a JSON Path specification is coming soon, and I'd like to cover the differences between it and traditional JSON Path.

Anyway, thanks for tuning in.

_If you like the work I put out, and would like to help ensure that I keep it up, please consider [becoming a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/gregsdennis)!_
