# Community Engagement

Questions, suggestions, corrections.  All are welcome.

Channels for community engagement (where I'll be looking) include:

- Issues
- Slack (link in the README)
- StackOverflow (tag with `json-everything`)

## Submitting PRs

Please be sure that an issue has been opened to allow for proper discussion before submitting a PR.  If the project maintainers decide _not_ to merge your PR, you might feel you've wasted your time, and no one wants that.

# Development

## Requirements

This site is a typical [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) website.  They list all of the requirements to run the site on their page.

The template is modified from the [Chirpy template](https://chirpy.cotes.page/).

Once all of the dependencies have been installed, you can run the site with one of the `run` scripts in the repository root.

## IDE

I use Visual Studio Code with the extensions it recommends at you, but you can use whatever you feel comfortable with.

## Code Style & Releases

While I do have an `.editorconfig` that most editors should respect, please feel free to add any code contributions using your own coding style.  Trying to conform to someone else's style can be a headache and confusing, and I prefer working code over pretty code.  I find it's easier for contributors if I make my own style adjustments after a contribution rather than forcing conformance to my preferences.

## What Needs Doing?

Anything in the [issues](https://github.com/json-everything/json-everything-docs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) with a `help wanted` label is something that could benefit from a volunteer or two.

Outside of this, PRs are welcome.  For larger changes, it's preferred that there be some discussion in an issue before a PR is submitted.  Mainly, I don't want you to feel like you've wasted your time if changes are requested or the PR is ultimately closed unmerged.
