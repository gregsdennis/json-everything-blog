## Welcome

This repository houses the source for `json-everything` blog site, https://blog.json-everything.net.

## Contributing

We're happy to accept and review proposals for blog content.  Ideally, posts will cover:

- updates to the libraries or project in general
- how the libraries are being used
- interesting things learned while working on or with the libraries

The main project's [CODE OF CONDUCT](https://github.com/json-everything/json-everything/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) also applies.

## Running locally

The site is a standard [Jekyll-based GitHub Pages site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll) using a modified [Chirpy theme](https://chirpy.cotes.page/).

You'll need to install the dependencies listed in the GitHub docs to run it locally.  Once all of the dependencies are available, you can run the `run.bat` or `run.sh` scripts to more easily start up the site.

## Style

Please see the [Chirpy theme site](https://chirpy.cotes.page/) for examples of the markdown that's supported.
